# Mini Project 4 - Django
# Due date: 11.06.2022


## A description of what the project is for.

    A tutorial of Django framework in conjunction with Bootstrap. Compared to
    flask this handles the database requests faster, in that you don't actually
    write any of the SQL, or SQL adjacent, code. This has more moving parts compared
    to Flask. Although, you can compartmentalize parts of your webservice easier.

## Instructions for how to develop, use, and test the code.
    # Django Installation
    # Source: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/install/

    # Installation
    Python Version
    We recommend using the latest version of Python. Djanog supports Python 3.5
    and newer, however, you will have to pay attention to which Django version
    you use.
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/faq/install/#faq-python-version-support

    To install Django on Windows, create a project folder:

        >>> mkdir myproject
        >>> cd myproject
        >>> py -3 -m venv venv

    Activate the Virtual Environment(venv):

        >>> venv\Scripts\activate

    Note: execute the following command if there is a permission error within the venv:

        >>> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

    And finally, install Django:

        >>> py -m pip install Django
